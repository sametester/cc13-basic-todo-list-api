Create a new repo at github.

Clone the repo from fedorahosted to your local machine.

git remote rename origin upstream

git remote add origin URL_TO_GITHUB_REPO

git push origin master

Now you can work with it just like any other github repo. To pull in patches from upstream, simply run 

git pull upstream master && git push origin master.
